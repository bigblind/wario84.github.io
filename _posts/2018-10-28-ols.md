## Deriving Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)
Is an estimation method for linear relationships between one or more explanatory variable(s), or independent variables $x_i$, and a response variable variable $y$ on a $\beta_p$ set of parameter(s).  The interest of the estimation lies on finding values for the unknown $\beta_p$ parameters of a linear system.

%A key assumption about the estimation is that there is an underlying model or structural equation that if correctly specified, it will contain all the explanatory variables systematically affecting the response variable.

$$y_i= \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 + \dots \beta_px_p$$

The OLS model is a system of equations with $\textit{p}$ unknown coefficients for each explanatory variable and one intercept and $\textit{i}$ equations. In order to solve the system, or in other words, to find estimates for the parameters, is necessary to consider three scenarios:


 * $i<p$ The system is underidentified and inconsistent with infinite of solutions. 
 * $i=p$ The system is identified, consistent with unique solutions.
 * $i>p$ The system is overidentified, usually inconsistent with multiple solutions.


OLS typically is a method that attempts to find solutions for the overidentified system. For instance, in real life applications, there is a certain population process that is at least partially explained by our model. Additionally, we have data that contains information or observations about this process, where usually we have more equations (observations) than unknown parameters in our model. The goal is to find a unique set of coefficients for each \textit{p} explanatory variable(s) that best fit certain criteria. For instance, consider a model with no intercept and two unknown parameters which can take values of any real number, by setting $\beta_1=4$ and $\beta_2=3$, we have:

$$ y_i = \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2   \left\{
\begin{array}{l}
       24 =  (4)*2 + (3)*4 + \epsilon  \\
       18 = (4)*3 + (3)*2 + \epsilon \\
       19 = (4)*4 + (3)*1 + \epsilon \\
       \end{array} 
\right. $$
